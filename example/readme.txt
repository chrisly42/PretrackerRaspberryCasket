This is a bare-bone example on how to use the replayer.
It features Pink's song Plastic Dove (from the Coda Intro).

Even though it features the full replayer code and tune,
the replayer including my demo framework and the song only
takes a mere 6560 bytes (shrinkled), which is even smaller
than the new streaming replayer used in Pink's new streaming
player demonstrated (closed source) in

https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=91551

which is 6860 bytes.

The Raspberry Casket replayer takes an average of 14
rasterlines while Pink's new streaming player takes
only about 10 rasterlines.

However, the song is not really busy and very short (1:35).
This means, regarding file size, this streaming format will
always lose against storing the full song data.

But anyway, I think I will create a compact streaming
format later next year (2023), too.
